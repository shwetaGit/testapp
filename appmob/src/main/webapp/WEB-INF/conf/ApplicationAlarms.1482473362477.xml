	Application Alarm Configurations are based on Domain Driven Design
	Alarms are configured as per Bounded Context and Domain wise

	Bounded Context
		Domains
			Alarms are classified into the following App Architecture Layers

			1 = WEB SERIVCE
			2 = DOMAIN SERVICE
			3 = DATABASE SERVICE
			4 = EXTERNAL SERVICE
			5 = EVENT BUS
			6 = ANALYTICS SERVICE
			7 = SCHEDULER SERVICE

	Every Alarm has the following properties

		Alarm ID (Unique ID) : Combination fields from Below. From Bounded Context to Event Action.
		==
		Bounded Context ID
		Domain ID
		Alarm Layer (Web Service, Domain Service, Database Service etc)
		Alarm Severity (Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Critical, Fatal)
		Alarm Context
		Alarm Status (Based on HTTP Status Codes)
		Event Action (Based on Unix File System Permissions)

		Message
		Diagnosis
		Solution

	For Every Alarm you can define the Alarm Log properties for various Log Connectors like Database, 
	File, Syslog, Splunk etc

	Alarm Severity represents the state of the Alarm respective to that specific part of the App.

		0 = Trace
		1 = Debug
		2 = Info
		3 = Warning
		4 = Critical
		5 = Fatal
	
	Alarm Status Code is classified based on HTTP Status Codes 

		1xx = Informational
		2xx = Success
		4xx = Client Error
		5xx = Server Error

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

	Event Action which Triggered this Alarm : Based on Unix File Permissions

		1 = UPDATE
		2 = WRITE
		3 = WRITE & UPDATE
		4 = READ
		5 = READ, UPDATE
		6 = READ, WRITE
		7 = READ, WRITE & UPDATE
		8 = DELETE

	Alarm Log Priority is based on every connector. A Severity 1 Alarm can have log Priority of 5 for 
	File Connector and Log Priority of 1 for Database Connector. Which means even though the Alarm 
	Severity is low it should be logged into File and not into the Database.

	This gives a very granular control on switching on an Alarm for a specific Bounded Context
	or a Domain in App Runtime without disturbing the App or losing the App State and without
	incurring performance penalties.

	System Automatically Generates a Unique Alarm ID which contains the following
	BoundedContextID, Domain ID, App Layer, Severity, Alarm Context, Status

	Eg. SHPPR456107402 : It Says web Service Call failed in the Shopping Context Product Search with Severity 5

		SHP = Bounded Context ID : Shopping Module
		PR  = Domain ID : Product Catalogue
		4   = App Layer - Web Service
		5   = Alarm Severity (Critical)
		6   = Event Action (Read, Write)
		107 = Alarm Context
		402 = Status Code : HTTP Status Code

		Auto Generated Alarms from Framework Template ........................ 
		Only following Parameters of an Alarm CAN be changed 
		in the Application running in the Production Mode. 

		Enable Domain Trace          : Will enable All the Alarms to

		Alarm Connector Log Priority : For Database, File, Syslog, TCP etc.. 
		Message, Diagnosis, Solution : Donot change the parameters of the
